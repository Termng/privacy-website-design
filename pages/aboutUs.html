        <h2>Our story</h2>
        <p>In 2014, we had an idea for a better way for people to pay. Virtual cards were pretty much unknown then and many of the features we wanted in a payments product didn’t exist. So we got to work. We built our own issuer processor technology while simultaneously developing a web app, mobile app, and browser extension to make it as easy as possible to pay privately and securely.</p>
        <p>This suite of technology and solutions became Privacy, which today is one of the leading providers of virtual cards to consumers and businesses in the US.</p>
        <p>We’ve powered billions in payment volume and we’re proud to have helped hundreds of thousands of users save millions of dollars from fraudulent charges and safeguard their financial info from hacks and data breaches.</p>
