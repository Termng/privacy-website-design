                <p>
                    When you pay a merchant without using a Privacy Card, you provide your credit or debit card number, CVV, and expiration date. This sensitive data can be intercepted or stolen by third parties, leaving you vulnerable to data breaches and fraudulent card activity.

                    Privacy Cards act as a secure layer between your payment information and the merchant. When a Privacy Card is used for a transaction, the merchant only has access to the Privacy Card’s unique card number; your actual financial info is never revealed and is safeguarded from data breaches. The Privacy Card can only be used at that specific merchant and, for even more protection, can be set to automatically close after the first transaction.
